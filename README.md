# Exercise 3 - For loops and conditional statements (10 points)

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand `for` loops and conditional statements in Python.
Below you have a series of problems in which you are asked to edit the notebook files and write the code necessary to produce the desired results.

After making your changes to the notebook, you will need to upload it to GitHub.

- Don't forget to check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L3/exercise-3.html#exercise-3-hints) if you're having trouble.
- **Exercise 3 is due by the start of the next lesson (9:15 am, 23 September 2020)**.
- **We are [working in pairs](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/why-pairs.html) on this exercise**, and we will only grade the repository of the member of your pair that is responsible for this week's exercise. 


## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 3 repository

Before starting to work with the actual problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 3 repository (e.g. exercise-3-htenkanen) into the instance using Git as we saw in [**lesson 2**](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).

## Start working

There are 4 problems in this week's exercise. Problem 4 is optional, but fun!

1. [Problem 1 - Batch processing data files with a for loop (2 points)](Exercise-3-problem-1.ipynb)
2. [Problem 2 - Classifying temperatures (4 points)](Exercise-3-problem-2.ipynb)
3. [Problem 3 - Allocating locations (4 points)](Exercise-3-problem-3.ipynb)
4. [Problem 4 - Nested `for` loops (*optional*, 0 points)](Exercise-3-problem-4.ipynb)
